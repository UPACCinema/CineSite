<h2><a name="get">Getting Started</a></h2>
<OL>
  <LI><font face="Arial">When do we get started?</font></LI>
</OL>
<P>As soon as you can. Either you will get a notice in the club mailbox in the 
  Union, or you will be contacted directly from the Saturday Night Coordinator 
  (SNC). Usually the notices in the mailbox goes out the semester before the scheduled 
  semester. For example, if this is the Fall 02 semester, we would have sent a 
  notice out a month or two before the end of the Spring 02 semester ended.</P>
<P>If you did not get a notice, then the SNC may have attempted to contact you 
  directly by either 1) finding out who is in charge through the Administration’s 
  Office list, or 2) sending a member, officer, or friend of the aforesaid electronic 
  mail, or lastly 3) calling any of these people on the phone. In practice, the 
  SNC usually doesn't take the time to hunt down the clubs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<OL START=2>
  <LI><font face="Arial">How do I get started?</font></LI>
</OL>
<P>If you have been contacted, or even if you <I>have not</I>, the first step is to submit a list of one to four movies to the SNC. Please rank them in preference  in a descending order. It would also help to tell us around which month you want to show this film.  Saturday nights are split between club films and the Midweek and Repertory film series, so the number of Saturdays availible are extremely limited.</p>
<p>
Bear in mind that the Friday Night Film Series will take all the &quot;blockbusters&quot; - usually - not always though. The Midweek Film Series will attempt to schedule films that are more &quot;culturally enriching,&quot; but they have been to known to do popular films as well.</P>
<P>If you feel that you MUST have a new film that has come out, you need to negotiate this with the SNC and the chair of UPAC Cinema<B>BEFORE</B> the movie schedule  has been set.The schedule is made towards the end of the previous semester.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<OL START=3>
<LI><
<OL START=3>
  <LI><font face="Arial">Who Do I contact?</font></LI>
</OL>
<P>The person to contact is the Saturday Night Coordinator, or SNC for short. 
  This person can be contacted via electronic mail at upac-cinema@rpi.edu. This 
  address is a mail alias to all the coordinators and the president of UPAC Cinema. 
  If you get no response, you may feel free to leave us a message at our office 
  number - 276-8585; or continue to spam that electronic mail address.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<OL START=4>
  <LI><font face="Arial">What if the movies have been scheduled already, can I 
    still participate?</font></LI>
</OL>
<P><b>Yes.</b> Well, usually. If all the Saturday slots have not been taken, you 
  can negotiate with the SNC to obtain a scheduled movie. </P>
<P align="right"><a name="lot">[Top]</a></P>
<h2>
  <P>The Lottery</P>
</h2>
<P>After the SNC has received the movie ideas via electronic mail, he will hold 
  a lottery where he picks which ranks the clubs in preference to be scheduled. 
  The exact date of this drawing will be posted on the notice that goes out to 
  the clubs. If your club has already shown a movie in the current semester of 
  the drawing, preference is given to those who have not participated yet. </P>
<P>After the lottery you <I>might</I> be given a letter that indicates that you 
  were given preference and that we’re trying to schedule your movie, otherwise 
  it’ll say that we can’t show your requests. If you are not scheduled, DO NOT 
  give up! There are good chances you can show another scheduled movie that another 
  club doesn’t want or can't do. The memo that tells you that you’ve got the reservation 
  looks something like this: </P>

    <P><font face="Courier">Dear The Ballroom Dancing Club,</font></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P><font face="Courier">I am happy to inform you that your club has been selected 
      to show a movie with us for Saturday films in this semester. At this time 
      we are in negotiations with the distributor as to the exact date of this 
      showing. Once this date has been agreed upon by us (UAPC-Cinema and the 
      distributor), we will then contact you with the details.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Courier">Please also bear in mind that you can read the contract 
      available from our homepage to see our terms and conditions. This memo to 
      you DOES NOT constitute a signed contract between you, the club, and us, 
      UPAC-Cinema. </font></P>
    <font face="Courier"><br>
    </font>
    <P><font face="Courier">Thank you for your time and efforts.</font></P>

<h2>
  <P>The Movie is Scheduled</P>
</h2>
<P>Once the date has been settled upon between UPAC and the distributor, we will 
  attempt to contact all the clubs and tell them that their films have been scheduled. 
  At this point a decent amount of time has passed and the request for a movie 
  by a club, and the name associated with that request my have been lost in the 
  shuffle. This is why it is important that if you’re doing a movie with UPAC-Cinema, 
  you should <B>FOLLOW UP</B> with us to make sure that we’ve not lost track of 
  you. You should then receive mail to the effect that we either have scheduled 
  one of the movies, or were not able to schedule anything for you. Here is a 
  memo that exemplifies a positive response:</P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR><!-BLOCKQUOTE--> <font face="Courier"><!-SIZE=1--> </font> 
    <P><font face="Courier">Dear Gymnastics Club,</font></P>
    <font face="Courier"><br>
    </font> 
    <P><font face="Courier">I am happy to inform you that your request to show 
      "Addicted to Love" has been decided to be honored. UPAC Cinema has negotiated 
      with the distributor for the date of February 21th, 1998. This is a Saturday, 
      and the show times will be 7pm, 9:30pm. and midnight. If this seems acceptable 
      to you, then you need to take the next step. If for any reason you no longer 
      wish to show this movie, please notify me so that we may make this movie 
      available for someone else to show.</font></P>
    <font face="Courier"><br>
    </font> 
    <P><font face="Courier">What is the next step? The contact for your club or 
      the person in your club that is responsible for the club needs to get a 
      copy of the contract and fill it out. A link can be found at directly at 
      <a
href="contract.html">http://cinema.union.rpi.edu/clubfilm.html</a>. 
      Print this out and complete it. </font></P>
    <font face="Courier"><br>
    </font> 
    <P><font face="Courier">If you are a union sponsored club, then you want the 
      50/50 option. This basically allows you to take 50% of the profits after 
      overage and expenses and we assume all the risk. If you think you'll do 
      better with the Full option then you may choose to do it, but this option 
      makes you assume ALL of the risk, and you must post $1000.00 in your account 
      to do it. However, you get ALL the profits after overage and expenses. You 
      also PAY US for ALL LOSSES if there are any. </font></P>
    <font face="Courier"><br>
    </font> 
    <P><font face="Courier">You need to read the contract, in full, and sign it 
      to the effect that you understand it. Should you have any questions about 
      it, please feel free to call me (276 8585). There is no "Option A", and 
      the cartoons are not available as a matter of choice, if we have them, we 
      will show them. Just put the title of the film in the "Film Title" line, 
      and you can leave the others blank.</font></P>
    <font face="Courier"><br>
    </font> 
    <P><font face="Courier">Once you have read the contract and completed it, 
      you need to get it to me. At this point you should contact me so that I 
      can get it, review it, and go over what you need to get ready for the Saturday 
      Film.</font></P>

<h2>
  <P>The Contract</P>
</h2>
<P>As you can see from the memo, once you’ve been selected to show a movie and 
  it is scheduled, you need to fill out a contract and give it to the SNC before 
  a movie starts. The contract is a binding document between the Club and UPAC-Cinema 
  to ensure that all parties have been treated fairly and both understand what 
  they agree to when a movie is &quot;sponsored&quot; by a club. It is very important 
  that you read this contract and sign it to the effect that you <I>understand</I> 
  it. It is especially important if you’re doing a &quot;Full&quot; contract that 
  you understand that it is possible that you can lose you’re $1000.00 that you’re 
  posting in your account.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><b>Where do I find the contract?</b></LI>

<DIR>
  <P>The contract can be found in two places: </P>

  </OL>
</OL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
  <LI><b>When do I turn the contract in?</b></LI>
</UL>
<P>You need to sign the contract and turn it in to the SNC at least a week before 
  the scheduled date of the film. The sooner the better since it makes for less 
  stress for the SNC. If you have any questions or special cases, we can work 
  things out with you. Just contact us at the electronic mail or phone number 
  should you need to.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
  <LI><b>What about the options?</b></LI>
  <UL>
    <LI><U>Cartoons</u> - You have no choice over cartoons. If we have them we 
      will show them</LI>
    <LI><U>&quot;Full&quot; Option</u> - You should talk to your club coordinator 
      in the Admin office about this if you want to do it.</LI>
    <LI><U>&quot;50/50&quot; Option</u> - You should do this if you are Union 
      funded and/or do not want to risk any money to show the movie.</LI>
    <LI><U>Show Times</u> - We can negotiate special times if it is not for a 
      Saturday, otherwise the standard is 7pm, 9:30, &amp; Midnight. This may 
      change slightly if it is a long movie.</LI>
    <LI><U>Account &amp; Subcode</u> - This is where we make your payment, or 
      debit your account. Please make sure that this number is correct.</LI>
  </UL>
</UL>
<P align="right"><a name="run">[Top]</a></P>
<h2>
  <P>Running the Movie</P>
</h2>
The night of the movie, you'll need to have <U>six</U> members of your club there 
at all times (according to the contract). These people do not need to be the same 
six people all night, but at least six people at any given time. We usually split 
it up this way: <br>
<UL>
  <LI>2 people selling tickets,</LI>
  <LI>1 person ripping tickets,</LI>
  <LI>1 person selling concessions,</LI>
  <LI>and the last 2 people doing security inside the theater. </LI>
</UL>
It is your group's responsibility to clean the theater after every show, please 
make sure that there are enough hands to do this after the movie ends.<br>
<P><B>Concessions</b> - You have the option of selling your own concessions during 
  the movie. You need to tell us (the SNC) if you are going to since we will need 
  to prepare ahead of time if you are. If you do not want to sell concessions, 
  you may have UPAC-Cinema sell theirs, however you do NOT get the profits from 
  these sales, nor do you get any "discount." If you sell your concessions, UPAC 
  members do NOT get their discount on your items. Whoever buys the candy needs 
  to tel the SNC if the club expects UPAC-Cinema to buy back the concessions. 
  If you do, you must abide by some guidelines. UAPC-CINEMA IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION 
  TO BUY BACK ANY CONCESSIONS FROM THE CLUB. We ask that you follow these guidelines 
  so that we can facilitate your request to buy your concessions back. There are 
  only two: don't buy more than <FONT COLOR="#008000">$125.00</FONT> worth of 
  food, and don't pay taxes! On many occasions I have seen the profits of a club 
  been wiped out because they've paid taxes. You can get a "no-tax" code from 
  the Administration office, and then find someone willing to take you to the 
  store. Ideally if you know someone who has a <a href="http://www.samsclub.com">Sam's 
  Club</a> or <a href="http://www.bjswholesale.com">BJ's</a> membership, corner 
  them to take you.</P>
<P>Lastly, keep you receipt! We will be unable to buy you concessions back from 
  you if we don't know how much you paid for them. We usually count what is left 
  over, take that percentage of what is left and apply it to the receipt to get 
  a number.</P>
<u>Concessions Suggestions</u>: We have gotten these in the past and they sell 
(from fastest to slowest): Kit Kat, <a href="http://www.m-ms.com">M+M plain & 
peanut</a>, <a href="http://www.snickers.com">Snickers</a>, Combos, Crunch, Twix 
Butterfinger, Milky Way, 3 Musketeers, Baby Ruth, Mounds, Starburst.<br>
<u>For sodas</u>: Coke and <a href="http://www.pepsi.com">Pepsi</a> of course, 
Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper, Sprite, <a href="http://www.7up.com">7up</a>, Minute 
Maid Orange, Canada Dry, Snapple Iced tea, AZ Iced tea, and Veryfine Juices.<br>
<P><B>Alcohol</b> - Yeah I know it stinks, but we can't let anyone in with alcohol. 
  They can reek of high heaven of it, but no alcohol out side of the body in any 
  container. We are obligated by the institute to follow up on this. If you have 
  belligerent customers, please get the SNC, or another UPAC person to help you 
  before any more confrontation.</P>
<br>
<P><B>Selling tickets</b> - Before you sell any tickets you will need to fill 
  out a "ticket sales" sheet for accounting purposes. The coordinator on duty 
  that night will give you one and show you how to do this. DO NOT SELL ANY TICKETS 
  prior to completing this sheet. We calculate your profit from these numbers, 
  so it is imperative that you fill it out.</P>
<P>While you are selling tickets, you may be approached by another general UPAC-Cinema 
  member. He or she will need to announce their name and tell you which team they're 
  on. You then need to check with the coordinator to make sure that this checks 
  out before you give them their free ticket.</P>
<P>Generally we say kiddies get in for free, and we say 10-12 is the cut off year 
  of age for that. You can negotiate that number with the SNC if you wish to change 
  it.</P>
<br>
<P><B>Ripping Tickets </b>- Please make sure that the people who are ripping tickets 
  at the door rip everyone's ticket and keep the stubs. We do NOT throw the extra 
  stubs in the trash, we keep them. Please be aware of this.</P>
<br>
<P><B>Letting People In: </b>- Please do not let people in until you get authorization 
  from the SNC, or the projectionist. We (UPAC) has to make sure the quality of 
  the film and equipment is ready. This may requre us to run some test film or 
  such activities, and we do not want people in the theater when this happens. 
  So, again, DO NOT let people in until a UPAC coordinator or projectionist indicates 
  that the theater is ready.</p>
