<p>Video arcade owner Kevin Flynn is desperate to prove that his video game programs, which have become enormously popular, were stolen from him by his boss at ENCOM, from where he has been terminated. Day after day, he tries to hack into ENCOM's systems, trying to find the information he seeks, only to be thwarted time and again by ENCOM's Master Control Program. The MCP, the "Big Brother" of ENCOM, has been making life difficult for everyone real and virtual, all for the ultimate goal of global domination. One night, after breaking into ENCOM in yet another attempt to get some answers, Flynn is forcibly pulled into the virtual world by the MCP. In this world, programs (who are the doubles of their users) are being subjugated by the MCP, his right-hand man Sark, and the Warrior Elite of the MCP for their continued faith in their users. Unless the programs pledge allegiance to the MCP and renounce their users, they are subject to constantly being forced into gladiatorial contests on the Game Grid until they de-rezz (die). Flynn must find TRON, the heroic system security program and the only one who can stop the MCP's madness, and help him destroy the MCP to stop the injustices the MCP has been inflicting in both the real and virtual worlds.</p>

<p>What Jake Vig doesn't know just might get him killed. A sharp and polished grifter, Jake has just swindled thousands of dollars from the unsuspecting Lionel Dolby with the help of his crew: Insideman Gordo, Shills Miles, and Big Al--and two corrupt LAPD officers, Lloyd Whitworth and Omar Manzano. But when both Lionel and Big Al turn up dead, it becomes clear that Lionel wasn't just any mark--as Jake soon learns, he was an accountant for eccentric crime boss Winston King. Never one to shy away from a challenge, Jake offers to repay The King by pulling off the biggest con of his career. The mark? Morgan Gillette, a banker with deep ties to organized crime. With so much riding on the outcome, Jake decides to bring in a brash, blonde pickpocket named Lily, who joins the crew in a complex scheme involving corporate loans, creative accounting, wire transfers and off-shore accounts. Jake and his crew will have to stay one step ahead of both the criminals and the cops to finally settle their debt. </p><hr>

<p>The plan was flawless... the job was executed perfectly... the escape was clean. The only threat mastermind thief Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) never saw coming was a member of his own crew. After pulling off an amazing gold bullion heist from a heavily guarded palazzo in Venice, Italy, Charlie and his gang -- inside man Steve (Norton), computer genius Lyle (Green), wheelman handsome Rob (Statham), explosives expert Left-Ear (Mos Def) and veteran safecracker John Bridger (Sutherland) - can't believe when one of them turns out to be a double-crosser. Enter Stella (Theron), a beautiful nerves-of-steel safecracker, who joins Charlie and his former gang when they follow the backstabber to California, where they plan to re-steal the gold by tapping into Los Angeles' traffic control system, manipulating signals and creating one of the biggest traffic jams in LA history. Now the job isn't the payoff, it's about payback.

<p>Already living in a society that mistrusts them, the mutants are faced with even more discrimination after an unforeseen enemy - who may be a mutant with extraordinary powers - launches a devastating attack. The news of the assault causes a public outcry against the mutants, including renewed support for the Mutant Registration Act, and William Stryker, a military leader rumored to have experimented on mutants (possibly including Wolverine), is among the most vocal supporters of the legislation. Stryker puts into motion a plan to eradicate the mutants and begins an offensive on the X-Men mansion and school. Magneto, having escaped from his plastic prison, forms an unlikely alliance with Professor Xavier to stop Stryker. Meanwhile, Wolverine heads north to investigate his past.
