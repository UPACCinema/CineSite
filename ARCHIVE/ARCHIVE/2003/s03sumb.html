the house to see if it was a mysterious seventh person who done it. As they
do so, other people show up at the house and soon end up dead. Wadsworth
the butler has a good idea who did it, so he recreates all the events of
the evening to find out who. The results in three different endings.</p>

<p>Harry Potter is in his second year of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. He is visited by a house-elf named Dobby and warned not to go back
to Hogwarts. Harry ignores his warning, and returns. He is still famous,
although still disliked by Snape, Malfoy, and the rest of the Slytherins.
But then, strange things start to happen. People are becoming petrified,
and no-one knows what is doing it. Harry keeps hearing a voice.. a voice
which seems to be coming from within the walls. They are told the story of
the Chamber of Secrets. It is said that only Salazar Slytherin's true descendent
will be able to open it. Harry, it turns out, is a Parsel-tongue. This means
that he is able to speak/understand snakes. Everyone thinks that it's him
that has opened the Chamber of Secrets because that is what Slytherin was
famous for. </p>

<p>The Fellowship has been broken. Boromir (Sean Bean) is dead, Frodo Baggins
(Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) have gone to Mordor alone to
destroy the One Ring, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have
been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando
Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have made friends of the Rohan, a race
of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king,
Th&eacute;oden (Bernard Hill). The two towers between Mordor and Isengard,
Barad-d&uacute;r and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction.
The corrupt wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), under the power of the Dark
Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gr&iacute;ma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif),
have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth.
The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the
White (Sir Ian McKellen), who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured
him. One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis),
has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured
by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the
Ring has now begun...  </p>

<p>Alex, a teenage hooligan in a near-future Britain, gets jailed by the
police. There he volunteers as guinea pig for a new aversion therapy proposed
by the government to make room in prisons for political prisoners. "Cured"
of his hooliganism and released, he is rejected by his friends and relatives.
Eventually nearly dying, he becomes a major embarrassment for the government,
who arrange to cure him of his cure. A pivotal moment is when he and his
gang break into an author's home: the book he is writing (called "A Clockwork
Orange") is a plea against the use of aversion therapy, on the grounds that
it turns people into Clockwork Oranges (Ourang is Malay for "Man"): they
are not being good from choice (sentiments later echoed by the prison chaplain).
The film reflects this: many bad scenes in a Clockwork Orange are accompanied
by jolly music; if we are to experience them as we should, we have to do
it consciously, by realising they are bad, and not because the director tells
us so through the use of music and images. </p>

<p>Gotham City: dark, dangerous, 'protected' only by a mostly corrupt police
department. Despite the best efforts of D.A. Harvey Dent and police commissioner
Jim Gordon, the city becomes increasingly unsafe...until a Dark Knight arises.
We all know criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot...so his disguise
must be able to strike terror into their hearts. He becomes a bat. Enter
Vicky Vale, a prize-winning photo journalist who wants to uncover the secret
of the mysterious "bat-man". And enter Jack Napier, one-time enforcer for
Boss Grissom, horribly disfigured after a firefight in a chemical factory...who,
devoid of the last vestiges of sanity, seizes control of Gotham's underworld
as the psychotic, unpredictable Clown Prince of Crime...the Joker. Gotham's
only hope, it seems, lies in this dark, brooding vigilante. And just how
does billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne fit into all of this? </p>
