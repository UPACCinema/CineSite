<h2>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</h2><strong>
Wednesday, April 7<br>
7pm and 10pm</strong><br>
Midweek Film Series<br>
<em>Rated PG -- 110 minutes</em><p>

Starring : William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley<p>

Fast-paced, filled with exceptional special effects, many critics 
consider this episode to be among the best of the series. After an 
explosion on their moon, the Klingons have an estimated 50 years 
before their ozone layer is completely depleted, and they all die. 
They have only one choice - to join the Federation, which will mean 
an end to 70 years of wars. Captain James T. Kirk and crew are called 
upon to help in the negotiations because of their "experience" of the 
Klingon race. Peace talks don't quite go to plan, and eventually Kirk 
and McCoy are tried and convicted of assassination, and sent to Rura 
Penthe, a snowy hard-labor prison camp. Will they manage to escape? 
And will there ever be peace with the Klingons?

<h2>The Prince Of Egypt</h2><strong>
Friday, April 9<br>
7pm, 9:30pm and Midnite</strong><br>
Pop Film Series<br>
<em>Rated PG -- 97 minutes</em><p>

Voices of : Patrick Stewart, Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes and Michelle Pfeiffer<p>

Think of <em>The Ten Commandments</em> with songs and an all-star cast doing 
the voices. In the Charlton Heston role of Moses is Val Kilmer. Moses' 
brother Rameses, previously played by Yul Brynner, is now voiced by 
Ralph Fiennes. The story revolves around these two close brothers, 
Moses and Rameses. While Rameses is groomed to take over the land, 
his beloved brother Moses is a carefree prankster, until he learns 
the true secret of his past. His secret, of course, is that he is 
really a Jew. The Pharaoh Seti raised Moses as his son. Upon learning 
the truth of his past from a burning bush, Moses returns to Egypt with 
God on his side and demands that the Pharaoh (now his brother Rameses) 
must let his people go. With songs written by Oscar-winner Stephen 
Schwartz and sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, <em>The Prince of 
Egypt</em> covers all the classic story points of the story of Moses, 
including the ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea.

<h2>Star Trek: First Contact</h2><strong>
Saturday, April 10<br>
7pm, 9:30pm and Midnite</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/union/astrophysical/public_html/">
Astrophysical Society</a><br>
<em>Rated PG-13 -- 110 minutes</em><p>

Starring : Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Jonathan Frakes<p>

The action-packed and provocative story is based upon the double episode 
"The Best of Both Worlds" in which Captain Jean-Luc Picard and crew had
to deal with the dreaded Borg, a race of half mechanical, half biological
beings that travel the universe in hopes of assimilating all intelligent
life-forms into their gigantic and fearsome hives. <p>

The film begins as the Borg attack the Earth. Picard (still deeply 
traumatized by his experiences with the villainous creatures) longs 
to fight them, but Starfleet has forbidden it because they fear that 
the Borg could easily manipulate him. Disobeying orders, Picard sends 
the Enterprise E into the space melee and blows up their ship, but not 
before a few of the bio-droids escape and make it to Earth to enact 
a nefarious scheme. According to plan, the Borg survivors travel back 
to April 04, 2063, the day that scientist Zefram Cochrane is to test 
out the first warp-speed space craft. It was the invention of warp 
drive that caught the attention of an alien ship compelling them to 
come to Earth for the first time. The result was the formation of 
an alliance that saved the nuclear war-ravaged world from destruction. 
When the Enterprise crew members figure out the Borg plans, they 
must travel back in time to stop the Borg from killing Cochrane 
and taking over the past. Unfortunately for Picard, Cochrane proves 
to be a boozy neo-hippie eccentric and may not test his invention 
in time

<h2>Saving Private Ryan</h2><strong>
Friday, April 16<br>
7pm, 9:30pm and Midnite (Times *will* change a bit)</strong><br>
Pop Film Series<br>
<em>Rated R -- 169 minutes</em><p>

Starring : Tom Hanks, Edward Burns and Tom Sizemore<p>

Steven Spielberg directed this powerful, realistic re-creation of 
WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath. The story opens 
with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American 
cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller and 
GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha 
Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter 
of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 
24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally 
take a concrete pillbox.<p>

On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name "Ryan" stenciled 
on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall, learning 
that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in 
a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan, 
be located and brought back to the United States. Capt. Miller gets 
the assignment, assembles his diverse group of men and searches deep 
in enemy-held territory for Ryan. After they lose one man in a skirmish 
at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of 
losing more lives to save a single soldier.

<h2>A Civil Action</h2><strong>
Wednesday, April 21<br>
7pm and 10pm</strong><br>
Midweek Film Series<br>
<em>Rated PG-13 -- 112 minutes</em><p>

Starring : John Travolta, Robert Duvall and Tony Shalhoub<p>

Directed by <em>Shindler's List</em> screenwriter Steve Zaillian, 
this courtroom  drama is based on a true story and non-fiction book 
by Jonathan Harr. 
The case revolves around an incident in 1979 in East Woburn, 
Massachusetts where two drinking wells supplying water to the town 
were found to be contaminated with industrial solvents. When toxic 
waste was discovered later that year, suspicions arose that the 
local factories caused the pollution. The residents felt these 
companies were responsible for the unusually high rate of leukemia 
deaths amongst the town's children. Anne Anderson, a mother who lost 
her son Jimmy to leukemia, fronts an effort to bring a lawsuit 
against the major conglomerates Beatrice Foods and W. R. Grace and 
Co for their pollution crimes. This is a heavy-duty problem, because 
these companies have the money to squash these poor citizens. Enter 
Jan Schlichtmann, a personal-injury lawyer whose small law firm is 
hired to sue these industrial giants for millions of dollars in 
damages. He's up against Jerome Facher and William Cheeseman, 
high-priced lawyers who represent the big companies.

<h2>The Thin Red Line</h2><strong>
Friday, April 23<br>
7pm, 9:30pm and Midnite</strong><br>
Pop Film Series<br>
<em>Rated R -- 170 minutes</em><p>

Starring : Sean Penn, John Cusack and Nick Nolte<p>

Reclusive director Terrence Malick returns to the big screen after 
a twenty-year absence to make an epic World War II movie the same 
year as Spielberg's <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>. Malick's first two films, 
<em>Badlands</em> and <em>Days of Heaven</em>, were widely praised for
 beautifully 
capturing rich characters with grandiose ideals, and this theme 
is again explored in the tumultuous setting of wartime Pacific 
Islands. Using the old "War is Hell" adage, Malick uses an all-star 
cast to remind us that beauty and self-doubt still exist in times 
of horror and complex violence. <p>

Based on James Jones novel of the same name, the story is more an 
intimate character drama rather than a loud action film. The story 
centers on an army unit called Charlie Company whose members are 
brought into the Pacific island of Guadalcanal. Filled with fear 
and self-doubt, these men will have to prove their courage and 
abilities in their bravery and sacrifices in an event which is 
bigger than all of them. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, the film is 
more of an exploration of the inner dialogues instead of tactical 
maneuvering. They're not searching outwardly for a person but 
inwardly for the courage to keep going. Like Malick's other films, 
it juxtaposes the beauty of its environments with the ugly realities 
of the time. The all-star cast includes many Hollywood heavies 
including George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack and John 
Travolta, but the story really focuses on Nick Nolte as Col. Tall and 
Sean Penn as First Sergeant Welsh, two tortured men dealing with the 
demons in their past as well as one the battleground.

<h2>Blade Runner</h2><strong>
Wednesday, April 28<br>
7pm and 10pm</strong><br>
Repertory Film Series<br>
<em>Rated R -- 114 minutes</em><p>

Starring : Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young<p>

In 1982, the dark, science fiction thriller Blade Runner was released 
to theaters; though this initial release would be considered a 
financial disappointment, the "future noir" about a hard-boiled 
android hunter and his beyond-human prey would proceed to become 
one of the most influential science fiction films of the 1980s, 
thanks in large part to the sleek cinematography, dystopic 
production design, and enigmatic, philosophical narrative.<p> 

In 1992, the 10-year anniversary of this landmark science fiction 
film was celebrated with the release of Blade Runner: The Director's 
Cut, a newly restored version of the film as initially conceived by 
director Ridley Scott. The plot, loosely derived from Philip K. 
Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by screenwriters 
David Webb Peoples and Hampton Fancher, remains the same: 'blade 
runner' Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to track down and 
eliminate a team of replicants, humanoid androids that have escaped 
from an outer-space mining colony and taken refuge on earth. During 
his search for the fugitives, in which he must try to separate the 
humans from the replicants, he discovers hidden secrets behind the 
replicants' manufacturer, the Tyrell Corporation. Blade Runner: The 
Director's Cut, however, removes several changes imposed by the 
studio during the film's initial release. Several brief special 
effects sequences are added, allowing further chances to observe 
the achievements of cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth and special 
effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull, but the most notable changes 
are the restoration of the film's originally intended ending, and 
the removal of Harrison Ford's noirish voice-over.

<h2>You've Got Mail</h2><strong>

Pop Film Series<br>
<em>Rated PG-13 -- 119 minutes</em><p>

Starring : Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan<p>

Sleepless In Seattle director Nora Ephron originally made a name for 
herself as the writer of romantic comedies such as <em>When Harry Met 
Sally</em> and <em>This is My Life</em>. She continues the genre with 
<em>You've Got Mail</em>, marking her second collaboration with actors 
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.<p>

The story brings romance and courtship into the electronic age of the 
World Wide Web via e-mail and chat rooms. Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly 
live and work blocks from each other on New York City's Upper West 
Side. Their lives are practically intertwined. They both shop at 
the same place, frequent the same coffee shop, and even own competing 
bookstores on the same street. They also both have significant others 
of their own. Joe has the overly hyper book editor Patricia Eden, 
while Kathleen lives with the scholarly newspaper columnist Frank 
Navasky. Then they meet in a chat room. Though they keep their 
identities secret, they tell each other everything about their 
lives, including their private feelings, which slowly turn into 
affection for each other. When Joe decides to expand his "Foxbooks" 
bookstore into a superchain, Kathleen, with her "Shop Around the 
Corner," is doomed. Surely her boutique business will be lost to 
the conglomerate with a built-in newsstand and coffee bar. When 
Kathleen confides her work woes to her e-mail buddy, Joe puts 
two-and-two together. How can he reveal himself to her now, knowing 
that he is the cause of her misery?
