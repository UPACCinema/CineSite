<title>UPAC Cinema Spring 1996 Schedule Updates</title>
</head><body>

Blade Runner was to be shown on Wednesday, February 21. Dued to circumstances 
beyond our control, Blade Runner is not with us at this time. We hope to have 
Blade Runner before Sunday, February 25, which will be the offical show date 
for Blade Runner.
<br> <br>
Goldeneye can not be obtained, but in it's place will be Ace Ventura: When 
Nature Calls. Goldeneye will be shown at a later date this semester.
