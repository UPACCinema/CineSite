<OL>



<FONT  SIZE=1><LI VALUE=1>This contract must be completed fully and submitted within one week from the Club Films Selection Meeting, or as specified by the UPAC Cinema Chair and the Club Films Coordinator by either being placed in the UPAC Cinema mailbox in the UPAC Office (RU 205) or in person to the Cinema Chair or the Club Films Coordinator.  Other non-Saturday night contracts must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the showdate.  Violation of this contract or the Club Responsibilities Sheet is grounds for refusal of future contracts.  UPAC Cinema will attempt to honor all requests unless physically unable to do so.  Any contract not submitted within the deadlines stated above may be charged a late fee of $25.00 or refusal of the request at the discretion of the UPAC Cinema Chair and the Club Films Coordinator.</LI>

<LI VALUE=2>This contract is not valid until all sides are read and signed by the sponsor and the necessary UPAC Cinema members.  Until that point this is simply a request and is no way binding on UPAC Cinema.</LI>

<LI VALUE=3>Any club wishing to participate in the 50/50 plan must be Union-funded at the time of the Club Films Selection meeting.  If a club is not Union-funded, it may not participate in the 50/50 plan.  A film may denied if it does not meet budget requirements as specified in the current UPAC Cinema Budget.</LI>

<LI VALUE=4>Sponsors using the full payment option must have the funds to do so.  Union-funded organizations are usually not budgeted for this, and they must either receive Executive Board approval or choose the 50/50 option, where the net profit is split between the sponsor and UPAC Cinema.  For both options, the cost of the film, cartoon if requested, publicity as required by the contract, all postage and projectionist fees will be deducted from the collected income (Saturday films) or billed to the sponsor (non-Saturday films).  The sponsor is responsible for any additional costs.</LI>

<LI VALUE=5>Any sponsor failing to fulfill this contract or the Club Responsibilities Sheet will be penalized as follows:</LI></OL>

<UL>

<LI>The organization may be refused contract approval for a period decided upon by a vote of the UPAC Cinema officers.</LI>

<LI>The organization may have their profit reduced by an amount set by a vote of the UPAC Cinema officers at a UPAC Cinema business meeting.  If UPAC Cinema’s share of the profit is less than $50.00 then the club will be billed for $50.00.</LI>

<LI>A full-payment option organization failing to meet any or all responsibilities will be billed for any net loss or have a percentage of their profit withheld.  The percentage will be determined by a vote of the UPAC Cinema officers.</LI>

<LI>Any organization providing less than 6 people to work at least one hour prior to the first show and throughout to the end of the last show, including at least three people to cleanup at then end of the night, will automatically be billed for 100% of any net loss or receive 25% of any net profit (if UPAC Cinema’s share of the profit is less than $50.00, then the club will be billed for $50.00).  In addition, the club will be billed for as many people as necessary (up to 6) to fill vacancies left by the club.  The Club Films Coordinator will obtain the people necessary to fill the vacancies, and they will be paid at $5.00 per hour with a 1 hour minimum.  The club will be billed for any such payment.</LI></UL>

<OL>



<LI VALUE=6>The sponsor is REQUIRED to report attendance figures to either the projectionist or the Club Films Coordinator for all UPAC Cinema-ordered films.  Funds collected will be deposited in the Union Depository into account #302410.3133 by the Club Films Coordinator (or by the projectionist for other films).</LI>

<LI VALUE=7>UPAC Cinema will order and return films for Saturday Night Club Films and on situations decided upon by the UPAC Cinema Chair.  UPAC Cinema can not guarantee the availability, arrival, or the condition of the film.</LI>

<LI VALUE=8>UPAC Cinema will also provide projectors necessary to show the film.  UPAC Cinema provides sound equipment in DCC 308.  The sponsor is responsible for obtaining sound equipment in any room other than DCC 308.  For some movies UPAC Cinema reserves the right to charge a $25.00 equipment fee.</LI>

<LI VALUE=9>UPAC Cinema officers may enter the theater at any time (list available upon request).  The sponsor is responsible for all advertising.  Promotional material is a $25.00 cost that the club must pay in order to show the film.  Other promotional efforts, beyond UPAC Cinema’s, on the part of the sponsoring organization are encouraged.</LI>

<LI VALUE=10>UPAC Cinema reserves the right to cancel a show under the following stipulations:</LI></OL>



<UL>

<LI>Loss or failure of equipment or subsystems, including loss of room reservation and the film does not arrive.</LI>

<LI>Sudden illness or injury of the projectionist requiring medical attention.</LI>

<LI>If the physical condition of the film is deemed too poor to show.  If time permitting, a reasonable effort will be made to find a replacement or substitute.</LI>

<LI>If starting or continuing a show poses a threat to the safety, health, and/or security of the building, its occupants, or the RPI campus.</LI>

<LI>By an order of any authority higher than UPAC Cinema, including, but not limited to, the Rensselaer Union Executive Board, Union Administration Office, Dean of Students Office, Public Safety, Troy Police, and Troy Fire Department.</LI>

<LI>Any extenuating circumstances beyond the control of UPAC Cinema.</LI></UL>
