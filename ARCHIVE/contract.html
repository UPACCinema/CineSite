<center><h1>Saturday Night Film Projection Contract</h1>
(for Union-funded clubs only, standard projection times)</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a contract between __________________ ("the club") and UPAC Cinema
("Cinema").

<p>The contract is an agreement to co-operatively produce an exhibition of
the film ________________________ on Saturday, _________ at showtimes 7pm,
9:30pm, and midnight at room DCC 308 on the RPI campus.

<h2>Club Responsibilities</h2>

By signing this agreement, the club agrees to provide the following:

<ol>
<li>A minimum of 6 (six) people to work under the direction of the UPAC
Cinema Saturday Night Coordinator ("SNC") at all times between the hours
of 6pm and 12:30am the evening of the performance, and;

<p><li>A minimum of 2 (two) people to work under the direction of the SNC
from 12:30am until 10 (ten) minutes after the conclusion of the last show
of the movie on the evening of the performance.
</ol>

<h2>Staffing Restrictions</h2>

<b>All personnel supplied by the club must be coherent, sober, and willing
to perform the duties assigned by the SNC.  Anyone not conforming, at any
time, to the requirements put forth by the SNC will be removed from the
DCC.  If this causes the club to fall below the minimum staffing
requirements outlined in this contract then the club will be considered in
breach of this contract.</b>

<h2>Revenue Sharing</h2>

At the conclusion of the exhibition, the SNC will determine the gross
proceeds from ticket sales to the exhibition.  The SNC will subtract the
cost of the projectionist, food for the SNC, projectionist, and
projectionists-in-training who were shadowing the projectionist during the
exhibition, the film rental, and any transportation and facilities costs.
The SNC will then direct the Union accountant to deposit one-half of the
remaining proceeds into the club's account.

<p>If the exhibition does not return a profit, the club is charged
nothing and receives no ticket revenue.

<p>The club may sell concessions during the exhibition.  If the club
wishes to sell concessions, it must notify the SNC at least 2 (two) weeks
in advance.  If the club does not so notify the SNC, Cinema reserves the
right to sell its own concessions, or to allow another organization to
sell concessions.  If the club wishes to sell concessions, it must
purchase them itself, and provide at least 2 (two) people between 6pm and
12:30am on the night of the exhibition, in addition to the 6 (six) already
required by this contract.  Any and all concession sales will be under the
direction of the SNC.

<h2>Penalty for Breach of Contract</h2>

If the club fails, in the sole judgement of the SNC, to fulfill the terms
of this contract in their entirety, the club agrees to immediately pay:

<ol>
<li>The cost of the UPAC Cinema Projectionist who performed the film
projection (approximately $72), and;

<p><li>The expense of 6 (six) Cinema staff members to produce the
exhibition (approximately $478.50).
</ol>

<h2>Additional Restrictions</h2>

Cinema reserves the following rights, without prior notification:

<ol>
<li>To substitute any other film if the film listed in this contract is
unavailable (for any reason) and/or damaged,

<p><li>To alter the showtimes or location of the exhibition, including
cancelation or addition of shows, to account for unexpected delays or film
lengths,

<p><li>To show any additional material during the exhibition that it deems
appropriate,

<p><li>To remove any material it deems inappropriate for the exhibition,

<p><li>To cancel the exhibition in its entirety, for any reason, without
penalty to the club,

<p><li>To cancel any part of the exhibition, for any reason, while still
distributing any profits according to the revenue sharing guidelines
listed above,

<p><li>To appoint another individual to assume the role of SNC for any or
all of the exhibition,

<p><li>To fully enforce any and all terms of this contract via any legal
means necessary, and;

<p><li>To produce or direct the production of the exhibition in any way it
deems appropriate.

</ol>

<p>This contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
and the regulations of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Student Union.  
If any section of this contract is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of
the agreement shall remain fully effective.

<p>If the tenure, in a capacity to enforce the terms of this contract, of
either of the signatories listed at the end of this contract ends before
the terms of this contract have been completely fulfilled, then the terms
of the contract shall still apply to the club and to Cinema, and both
