Mark...
	My name is Jim Holmes and I am a captain of the Ultimate Frisbee
team.  Could you send to me, or put in our club mailbox any info you have on
the Saturday Night movie series.  One other thing that I am not to clear on
in your letter, You say that the only film date reserved so far is 9/27 by
shpe.  Available dates that are already booked: 9/13, 9/20, 10/4.  And that
all other saturdays are open.  If a date is available, then how is it already
booked?  The reason I ask is for the Lost World date.  Our club did this once
a few years ago and got stuck with a crappy movie and made no money, and I
really only want to go thru with this if we can get a good movie.  Thanks

Hello Jim,

        Ok, 1st:  Point of clarification that dates up to 10/4 have already
been booked.  This means UPAC has a movie scheduled for that date as of NOW.
Dates beyond that are not scheduled, for a specific title, only reserved for
clubs that want to show a film that is not already showing on a Friday (or
Wends.).

        2nd.  IF you are interested in showing a movie with UPAC, you  
need to first get me a list of movies you want to show (at least 5) and
ranked preffered dates to show it on.  If you have trouble getting ideas
I can give you access to the catalog upon request (set an appointment
with me).  

	If UPAC can get it for that date, then we can enter a contract.

I don't know your name, but I am Adala Zelman, activities coordinator for the
Women Students Association.  I left a message on your answering machine a few
days ago aboutSsaturday club movie nights - the WSA is interested in having
one.  Are there any open spots left?  We have a few movies in mind to show,
our first choice being Antonia's Line, which won an Oscar for best foreign
film a few years ago.  Please let me know if we can get a night or not - by
email, or phone at 273-8274.

Thanks so much,

Adala

Mark,
	I left a message with someone at your home.  It said:
	I will be talking to Keith as he imparts all his knowledge onto me at
Tuesday's preview of Murder at 1600.  Yes, I was going to email Cris
updates as I go along, and taking notes of how I did it.  I was also going
to set up the other coordinators with duties.  
	Currently, the Chair is doing, what I feel, is more than one person should
be asked to do.  Concerning your keys.  We are declaring them lost, and
ordering up a new set.  Take the info I provide to Betty in the Admin
office.  She is in charge of keys.

You need 	QQ104  (Booth and room behind 308)
		12BFS  (DCC Classrooms)
		8C50  (Union Garage)
		8.4 (UPAC Office)
		10FS1  (Outside doors to DCC)
		Union Elevator key  
		Alan wrench/key to unlock/lock DCC doors
		Yale Drop Box Key
		And your money bag key.
		
The other keys you need are Cinema specific, so we'll have to look into
changing all the locks or getting new copies.  They are the three keys for
the various padlocks, the coordinators cabinet, concessions cabinet.

While you are with Betty, inquire about recurring the UPAC Room in the
Union Basement and the Booth in DCC.  I will also be asking her tomorrow
about that option.

Since you have a vehicle, I will ask if you can make a run to buy various
supplies.  I'll tell you what we need when we talk.  By the way, I am free
all day tomorrow, so that would be a good time to get together if we need
to do so before businesses close.

Also, there is some sort of Emergency Key box in the Cinema Closet in the
UPAC Room in the garage.  But none of my keys will open it.  Perhaps
Criselda will have the necessary key.  The Closet is, when you walk in, on
your left in far back corner.
However, only Cris and I have keys to it. 

--Eric

Mark,
	I have that Circle K contract.  It says one of their  movie choices is
Private Parts, this Saturday's movie.  I would call them and tell them that
Sept 6 is their movie.  Review the contract with them, mainly 4, 5, 6 of
Sat Night Club Responsibilities Sheet. 
They may provide their own concessions.  UPAC will not provide them.  We
will buy any they have left over at a reasonable price.  If I am not there
to buy them, (call me at home) agree upon a price, take the concessions,
and tell me.  I will get them the money later.
	The contact person for Circle K is Sara Schubert.  x7349, schubs@rpi.edu

	Look over the rest of the contracts, check our schedule to see if we are
already showing any of their picks, and let them know accordingly.  If we
aren't showing any of their picks, get their picks and (if any) preferred
dates to Criselda, who will book them accordingly.  Then find out what
dates she booked those movies, and call your clubs back with their dates.

	Sorry I left last night, but I felt miserable.  If you still want to go
over what you need to do, or have any questions, let me know.  The sooner
the better.  Also, I want to get this contract to you.  I have not seen
Private Parts, so I will be there Saturday, barring any illness.
	We missed you at the meeting: 4:30 Sundays

--Eric

Here is the first list.  The second involves getting keys made and locks
bought, which requires more coordination.

4 rolls of 1 inch macking tape.  It MUST be 1 inch.
1 roll duct tape
3 rolls of generic tickets.  They must be numbered, and of course of
different color.  I don't know where you might find these.  Maybe Office
Max?  Or even Sam's.

Bring your receipts to Martha in the office.  Give her the account number
302410.3133.009 

She will refund your money.

Thanks--Eric

PS  I am going to ask Grant or Eric Briant to go make copies of the non RPI
Coordinator keys.  You might want to join up so that you aren't both out
driving around.

If you want reimbursed for the
gas you use, first get a receipt from gas station, then go into the UPAC
office and look in the Cinema filing cabinet.  In the miscellaneous folder
is the Budget.  In there is the proper sub code (XXX) for UPAC van usage
(in faded hand written scribblings near the top of one of the pages)  Give
302410.3133.XXX  and receipt to Martha.  She will refund you.

Hey three,
	I would like movie selections by 9/19/97.  I will get you more info on
movie titles to pick from later this week, but just be thinking about it.

So Mark, try to get those other clubs set up, please.

Thanks, All

I got the catalogs and already had the chance to look through them...
Could you tell me if all of the movies in the catalogs are "available" for us
or if some restrictions apply, and also how can I know if they are available
in 35mm (and therefore I'd like to know their price in this format) because
only 16mm films seem to be listed...
CU.

Thomas

PS: Please reserve a Saturday night for the French Connection (we'll choose
the film pretty soon: just give us a deadline) before other clubs take every
Saturday. Thanks.

Ummm,  NO.  We have a very limited number of them which seem to walk away
on their own for some reason, so we would have to look at the cataloges to-
gether.  Sorry about the inconvienence, but we can't afford to let them walk
off.  
	Email me or call me when you can get together with me. I am generally free
anytime after 11am to 5pm during any weekday.
	Update:  Nov 1 and Nov 3rd have been reserved.

Hi Mark, this is Khurram Sunasara from Pakistan Student Association. We 
got your flyer in the activities fair regarding clubs wanting to host 
saturday movies. Our club was interested in the movie 'The Lost World.' 
What I wanted to know was whether our hosting the movie is still 
negotiable and how soon do we need to sign the contract. 

Thanks

A meeting on Thursday at 8pm is really going to suck. In fact I would
strongly recommend against it.  We are showing "Stand and Deliver" that
day and meetings during movies have historically never gone well. Also
since Eric S. (I think) is running that movie, he can't leave and I feel
it is very important to have him at any upcoming meetings.

I am not doing Stand and Deliver.  John Tsang's email had someone else 
doing it, though I forget who.  

However, I support Cris in that a meeting, at least between officers, is 
very necessary.  We need to clear the air on several issues.
Some Frat has 308 until 9.  If we meet at 9PM, while the movie is being 
set up, that would be great.  However, until I hear otherwise from Cris, 
I plan on meeting her in DCC at 8PM Thursday.

I will put up a sign explaining that the 7PM show was cancelled due to 
conflicts.  However, who ever really goes up to the Weekly's and checks 
the times?  However, the Semesterly's don't give any time.  Infact, I 
wonder how many people will show.  Anyway, my philosophy is to move on, 
and prevent it in the future.

The last Thanh and I knew, we were not given an assigned time for the Thursday
movie. Any info I passed along about it was listed as *TBA*. However, I admit
that i did not make a good attempt to find out when the movie was being
shown. As for what Thanh did, I do not know.

I think the showtime for Stand and Deliver was 10 PM only. Least that's
what everyone else told me. 

I put the right showtimes in the poster cases, at least. So you can't yell
at me for that. :) Hopefully, more people will glance at the cases than
they will at the weeklies. They've been in there since at least Saturday.

Corrections!

I think Stand and Deliver is supposed to be shown at 10 pm. (Carl is
right).  Since my thursday class ends at 7:30 pm ..... if someone can start
the movie at 7 pm,  then I will finish showing it.

I think that having a meeting at 8 PM on Sunday would be a bad idea
considering the current chair will be unable to make it.  Could all of the
officers and any other member make it to a meeting, say Thursday 8PM.  Right
before any preview.  I mean this Thursday.  I am hoping to explain my absence
of this past week and why Eric S was left in charge.  It has nothing to do
with "shirking" responsiblities, and everything to do with my responsibility
to Psi Upsilon.  Please, if anyone has any comments, concerns, gripes, please
e-mail them to me, call me at x7938, or set up a time when we can talk.  I am
tired of everyone assuming that someone else is chair.  I am.  I am sorry for
the delay, but I am doing my best under the circumstances.  If anyone has a
problem with the meeting time, please let me know.  But, as for now, I am
calling a meeting for Thursay at 8PM.  I will find a room to have  it in as I
think that DCC 308 will be in use.

Also, I recieved a call from a Prof. Marco here at RPI.  He and his students
are doing a project where they go out and find out how things are run in
organizations.  Maybe this will help us to get organized and also give us
some cool publicity.  If you think that this would be a good idea, (I have to
get back to him tomorrow)let me know so that I can let him know.

Thanks,
Criselda

A few thoughts :

1.) It looks like (from responses) that Tuesday night is it. Around
    the preview time.

2.) Publicity is due back any time now. Posters will be left in the
    UPAC office. ANYONE can get into the office 9am-5pm weekdays,
    or in the evenings. IF the door is locked, ask Cameron or one
    of the people in the office to open it. In the evenings, ask the
    building supervisor to let you in. HAVING NO KEY IS NO EXCUSE
    FOR NOT GETTING INTO THE UPAC OFFICE. Hell, the janitors will
    open the door if you ask nicely.

3.) As I said before - develop a mail alias for upac cinema
    membership and one for replying to comments / questions from
    the RPI community. An e-mail reminder goes a long way to 
    getting meeting attendance.

4.) Keep meetings focused. At this point, I'm used to the rambling
    nature of meetings, and don't really mind if they dragged
    (the preview was after the meetings, so it was 'worth' the wait),
    but the average member doesn't like to sit around forever. Couple
    that with most people doing their HW on Sundays... Sunday evening
    *may* be a bad time.

5.) We've all had good ideas. Let's discussthem Sunday at 8pm and
    get some action.

If we all pull our weight, things get done.

Tsk, tsk, tsk,
	 Currently, everyone is assuming me as Chair, and I can't blame them
anymore.  As the person running things, I will be calling for, I am sorry
to say this, an impeachment.  The official proceedings will move me to
chair, and I will find someone to replace me as FNC.  I did not plan to
usurp your position, but you are showing me no signs of effort in the area
of running things.  
	With the best of intentions I covered in your absence.  I expected to see
you today at the meeting, and was very disappointed.  I am aware of your
Hell Week, but if you were going to miss the meeting, I would have like to
know.  I drew this conclusion today, after the meeting, and have discussed
it with no one.
	I would like us to work together to run Cinema.
This is in no way personal, but purely professional.  

It does not please me to write this.  It would be nice to talk this over
with you (and Mark) in person.

My name is Bryan Sudarwo, I am the treasurer of the chess club. Last Friday,
I talked to Eric about helding a saturday night film program, to raise fund
for the chess club. He told me to contact you.

activity are Oct 25 and Dec 3. After discussing with other officers, we
decided that we would like to do this event on Oct 25. So if you please can
contact me about the procedure, because this is new to me. Eric mentioned
about contracts?

ok, my email address is sudarb@rpi.edu  ph: 272-9093 or 272-4294

Dear Bryan,

Unfortunately all the movie slots have been scheduled for this semester.
This means that if you want to sponsor a movie, you must sponsor one that
we've already scheduled.  If this is ok, with you, then we'll procede, 
otherwise, I will have to recommend that you wait till the lottery
for next semester.  Too many commas in that sentance.  

Email me back ASAP as to the conditions of this offer.

Okay, I failed to realize that I have an exam during the time that I set up
for the meeting.  It goes from 7- 8:30.  I would rather it be later than earlier.  If you have any suggestions, please let me know.  Right now, I'm looking at a
 meeting time of about 8:45 - 9:30, or however long it takes.  I also have an examon Wednesday and Thursday, so the meeting won't take long anyways.  The previewing of Inventing the Abbots will just be moved to about a half hour later.  
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hi Mark,

I am coordinating the movie night for the glba, as well, assuming you still
have dates open this semester.  We prefer October 25th or November 2nd if
they are available.

Our choices are:

1.When Night is Falling
2.The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love
3.Silver Like Life
4.The Hunger
5.Go Fish

Also, I was wondering if your previous message to me stood as confirmation of
WSA movie night or not - you only mentioned trying "*real* hard" and then
wrote that we would speak _next_ semester, which confused me.  When will we
know what the date is?  Do we need to sign a contract?  Do people from our
group need to work that night?  I have not joined forces with UPAC before, so
I am unsure of the procedure.

Thanks for all your help,

Adala

Dear Ms. Zelman

Per your last missive:

I will look into scheduling those movies that you have listed for the 
GLBA assoc.  Unfortunately, we have scheduled movies for the remainder
of this semester, so the probability of getting these movies scheduled
depends on how the Chair feels about changing the schedule. 

I will tell you the out come of out consultation about your request.
Meanwhile, I recommend considering an alternitive that we may likely
offer you: Sponsor a movie that we have scheduled for this semester.

Also, please keep us in mind later in the semester when we hold the 
poster lottery for the Spring semester movie slots.

Hi there.
	I'm Colin Fredericks, one of the guys who was there for the
activities fair with WRPI. You may remember that we were interested in
sponsoring a Saturday night movie in November. I have finally gotten my
hands on an application, which are only available on your web page. I
highly suggest putting some of them anywhere else on campus - they are not
available in the UPAC office, the Union admin office, the student
government office, or any other place I would think to look for them. The
only form I could find was two years old and was in my backpack by sheer
luck.

	In any case, WRPI is still interested in having a movie on November
8th. If you could tell me what I should do with our application, it should
be completed by Wednesday and I can get it to you then. We're still looking
at Pump Up the Volume as our first choice, with Pulp Fiction, Holy Grail,
and Trainspotting as possible alternates. Thanks for your time.

Hello Mr. Fredericks,

If my memory serves me correctly, we have scheduled the movie "Pump Up the
Volume" for you.  I will find out when the movie is being shown, and then
I will get back to you.  Once the date and title have been confirmed,
we'll discuss further filling out the contract.

Sorry about the scarcity of the contract around campus.  We aren't all
together here at UPAC.  If the Chair would keep her office hours, she
could have given you a contract from the office.
	Oh well, Talk to you soon,
		- Mar

I thought that I had already spoken to you about this?  I told you that I wanted 
"The Princess Bride", over a week ago.  Perhaps there was a misunderstanding?

	Mark,

	I work for Ben and Jerry's (big surprise there) and Denise (our
wonderful manager) has gone about seeing if Ben and Jerry's could sponsor a
movie (that part has been settled). She asked for the Princess Bride (also
settled) as a Saturday night movie. Part that she would like to know is this:
when in the upcoming movie scheduale is it? We don't care about any of the
other movies, just that one.  I think Denise said she would see if she could
stop by on this coming Saturday night to see if she could track you down
during lost World. Unfortunately I can't go. I`m scooping 6-close.

See yoiu around.
Doug

Doug,

How is the scooping going over there.  So far I haven't see Denise during the
movie, but I am rather difficult to get a hold of.  I realize that you're not
interested in the whole schedule, but I think you guys should understand 
running an organization with a lot of overhead takes some time.  I didn't
have the schedule myself until yesterday.  

Ben and Jerry's has reserved with UPAC Cinema "The Princess Bride" for 
Saturday December 6th, 1997.  If you (B&J) wish to continue to honor
your request, I now ask of you to fill out a contract.  The contract can
be obtained from my Homepage.  ((http://www.rpi.edu/~staplm))
I recommend that you choose the FULL option, and then designate what you
wish to do with the profits.  THis can be added directly to the contract
itself or attached by another paper to the contract.  I will personally
see to it that Cameron gets a copy of the statement.  
	There is no cartoon available, skip it.  If you have no account
sub code - leave it blank.  Just put "The Princess Bride" in for the 
Film Title and leave the others blank.  Please have this contract signed 
and filled out (of course) to me by Oct 30th so that we may take care of
any further details.  Should you no longer be interested in showing a 
movie, I ask that you notify me asap so that we may allow another club
to sponsor a film as there is a lengthy list now for this semester.

	Thank you for your time and understanding of our normal operations
of buisness.  I look forward to running the film with you.

	- Mark Stapleton
      Saturday Night Coordinator - UPAC Cinema

Hi Marc.

If you have any information (or confirmation) for me, or you need the

Errata :

1.) What club / organization is sponsoring "The Professional"?
2.) What is the full title of the Wed 11/19 film? I assumed "My Best Friend's
    Wedding"
3.) What club / organization is sponsoring "The Princess Bride"?
4.) What club / organization is sponsoring "Mimic"?
5.) Time constraint - "Hamlet" is 238 minutes long. Does not fit time slot.
6.) Time constraint - "Pulp Fiction" is 154 minutes long. Does not fit
    time slot.
7.) Dunno runtime on "Operation Condor", but it shouldn't be a problem.

I think this covers the questions I have. If I could get answers ASAP, I'd
appreciate it.

1.)  The French Connection "club"   

3.)  Ben and Jerries.  (The ice cream place in the union.)  Might
I recommend that you try and do a cupon thing with them as a prom0-      
tional (in the semesterly).  Talk to the manager and tell her I
sent you, she'll understand.  I will also E-mail this suggestion
to her.

4.)  I forgot, I gotta look it up - perhaps Circle K.
Does anyone else remember for N-Spaced-out?

I believe French Connection is sponsoring the Professional, (may be wrong)
and (they told me this Friday night) Ben & Jerry's is doing the Princess
Bride. My Best Friend's Wedding is the right title for 11/19's film. 

Time constraints: Hamlet is running W at 7, and Th at 9, so no problem there.
Pulp Fiction (as well as Contact, which is 150 m) will run over by quite
a bit, and Face/Off (138 m.) shouldn't run over by more than 15 m.

Mark,

We might be interested in hosting another club's film, depending on the film.

How was it that we missed out on a Saturday?  What was the precedence for
choosing clubs?  I thought it was first come, first serve, and that we had
entered our movie choices in time (at least the WSA, if not GLBA)- otherwise,
couldn't you have told me then that there were no slots available?

Thank you for the information,

Adala

Are you sure, because last time I talk to Eric. And He told me that he had

Hi Sara,

Umm, I am pretty sure you put it down becuase I remember you discussing it.
We also had a buncha films already scheduled as well.  It pissed me off the
Rep Coord. stole Dune from you.  We got it, but he wanted it instead. Anyway,
if you don't want it, I can give it to someone esle.   

What do you want to do?

Listen, if you REALLY want to piss me off, do an End-run-around on me.
I AM THE CLUB CONTACT for Upac-Cinema.  You may know Eric, and talk
to him on a daily basis, but I HAVE THE FIANAL WORD.

No, ALL SLOTS HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED.

Have a nice fucking day,

Thanh and I plan to get the publicity ball rolling this weekend. I've got
all the details I can muster, but a few remain :

1.) Contact and Pulp Fiction run up against the 2.5 hour limit. In the past,
    we scheduled Pulp Fiction for 7pm, 10pm and 1am. should we do this 
    again? From experience... people DO NOT like to wait for late starts, esp
    if it's more than 10 or so minutes

2.) Was a mention of Nov 1 and Nov 8 flip flop between RSFA and WRPI. Is this
    true?

3.) I'd like Criselda, Eric S. and Mark S. to Look over the publicity
    BEFORE it goes to the printer. 

That's all

2).  No. The contracts are signed for the schedule it is listed for - as
far as i can remember.

3.) I am mailing you from BOSTON right now, so there is little chance that
I will be able to review it.  I trust you, go ahead.  If i have  a problem,
I'll deal.

Mark,

I have the contract ready to give to you, but your email with your phone
number has mysteriously disappeared from my files.  Could you tell me when
and where I could hand it off to you tomorrow?

Thanks,

Subject: UPAC - AS&MS and how to live together in DCC 308
Date: Tue, 14 Oct 1997 14:46:24 -0400
Encoding: 75 TEXT
X-UIDL: 850ac11fbb6386f8954a06c370c399ea
Status: R

Hello all,

My name is James Evans and I am the Director of Academic Support & Media 
Services.
I know that I have spoken to some of you individually but felt it was time 
to have a more formal discussion on how to best work together in DCC 308.

I understand that you need a few things done in order to ensure that the 
UPAC movies are projected with the least amount of problems, i.e. glare 
from the television's mounted on the wall or audio from our sound system.

To ensure that neither of those two things happen, the UPAC staff has been 
shutting the power down to the entire rack located in the projection booth 
and killing the power to the monitors. I have received conflicting reports 
on how that is accomplished, so I thought it would be useful to let you 
know the correct procedure.

Audio
The only item that needs to be shut down in the projection booth to ensure 
that no other audio is broadcast in DCC 308 is the TOA audio amplifier.  It 
is a silver rack mounted piece of gear, located in the upper section of the 
rack in the projection booth. That drives what is being sent out to the 
room, if it is powered down nothing can be sent out to the speakers located 
in the ceiling.

Monitors
The breaker panel located on the wall, to the right of the main projection 
screen-as you are looking at the screen -above the black rack of equipment, 
contains the breaker's for the monitors.  The three that control the power 
to the monitors are labeled and the others should NOT to touched. The main 
breaker in the panel should never be thrown.  The other breakers in the 
panel supply power to the remote control system used in the room.  If power 
is cut inadvertently, and without shutting the system down first, we could 
have major problems.

Cleanliness
I have been informed that on numerous occasions the projection booth has 
been left a complete mess, i.e. there was a half eaten pizza left in the 
booth for close to a week before one of my technical staff finally found  
 out what smelled so bad and threw it out, in addition to the soda/food 
containers which are almost always left in there. I only ask that if you 
eat or do anything in there that you clean up after you are done. The 
cleaning crew does not go in there so if we don't keep it clean no-one else 
will.

When leaving
The only other thing I need to mention is that if you turn anything off, 
please turn it back on when you are done. There have been numerous 
occasions when the audio rack has been left off and a class is in there the 
next morning. This resulted in the Professor not being able to get any 
audio out of the system. Unfortunately, in most cases Technical Services 
only learns of the problem after the class is over, which by then is too 
late.

If you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to give me a 
call or contact me via email.

FYI
If you need to report any technical problems we now have an email address 
to use. It is:
avtechs@rpi.edu

Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.

Dear Mr. Evans,

Allow me to introduce myself.  I am the Saturday Night Coordinator for
UPAC Cinema.  Basically I am responsible for and run the Saturday films.

I wanted to take this moment and respond to your missive.  Basically
I think what you are asking for is very reasonable, but given UPAC-
Cinema's constituency, I don't think much will happen by way of your
request.  Allow me elaborate...

The Booth (projecting room behind DCC 308) has been a mess for longer 
than I've been a member (joined in 93).  This issue has been taken to
heart by some of us, including myself, and it seems that only when 
it gets dreadfully bad or we get sufficiently motivated, does anything
happen.  Just last week I had to take the trash out because nobody else
does!  (Including AS&MS staff).  This organization is very loosly 
held together and we have internal conflicts as to how things are being
done, so to ask of us to fine-tune our procedures from above is asking
for a merical as far as I am concerned.  It is not my intention to sound
flippent or to mock you in any way, but I wish to be frank so that we
might address resolving these issues in a practical manner.
	In such a spirit, I would like to suggest that you take the 







previous message to our pits and projectionists because they are the
people who commit the transgressions as you see it.  This my be a
chieved by relaying the message through Criselda (our fearless leader)
or by having Cris meet with someone in your staff personally to 
delineate the changes you'd like to see.  This other option is 
probably better if you see no other results in the next few weeks. 
We have films this week: Wed., Thurs., Fri., and Saturday.  You should
be able tell later this week if anyone payed heed.  

	I hope our pits and projectionists pay attention.  If you
need to take further action, please talk to Criselda <valdec@rpi.edu>
Thank you for bringing up your concerns.

Mark,

Thanks for your reply, let's give it a week and see what happens.  If after 
that week we still see the same problems, I will want to set up a meeting 
with the entire staff to discuss these matters.

Mark,

I tried contacting you last week, and didn't hear back from you, so I turned
the contract in to the UPAC office.  It is there for you.

It's taken care of. We have the first, they have the 8th.

Dear Mark,

I got your name through a friend and understand you may be able to help us
with the following.

I am from the Srilankan Students Association at RPI. Some of our friends  in
Albany(who are in no way associated with RPI) would like to show a foreign
language film (which they would bring themselves) at RPI (the audience would
include people from the Tricity area, not just RPI students). So I am
wondering if we can hire UPAC Cinema, and their equipment to show the movie.
The show can be scheduled any day of the week so that it doesn't clash with
the existing UPAC schedule. We would like to show the movie sometime in the
next couple of weeks.

If it is complicated for an outside organization to show the movie, our
association at RPI can be the responsible organization.

COuld you kindly give us some information on whether this is possible and how
we would go about arranging this?

Thank you very much.

Kiruba Sivasubramaniam
President
Srilankan Students Association

Hi there Matt/Mark (I can't remember),

Here is the movie list in order of descending preference:

1. The Color Purple
2. The Joy Luck Club
3. Fried Green Tomatoes
4. Antonia's Line
5. Thelma and Louise

We would like to show this on October fourth or eleventh, if possible.  Do
you get promotional posters with the movie?

We are interested in so-sponsoring movies with other clubs over the semester
(if we can show The Color Purple, we'd like to show it, perhaps, with BSA and
GLBA or, for instance, show Raise the Red Lantern with CSA, I Shot Andy
Warhol with GLBA, etc.,etc.).  Can we apply for more than one night to do
this?

Also, how does the showing work in terms of cost and profit?  How much does
it cost to obtain and show a movie?  How are the profits split?

Thanks for your help,

Adala Zelman
WSA Activities Coordinator

Re:		Movie Lottery Deadline = November 25th

Date:		Monday, November 03, 1997



Dear Prospective Club Participant,


     If you are interested in sponsoring a film next semester with UPAC-Cinema, I would like to invite you to participate in the movie lottery for next semester's films.  
     
     If you are so inclined, please send me five film choices that you think you would like to sponsor to me via E-mail   staplm@rpi.edu  , or by dropping the list off at the UPAC office at the Union.   Please rank them 1-5, 1 being the first choice.  Then specify whether you would like to have the film in the first half, or second half of the semester.  

     The drawing* will be held on around Thanksgiving, because that is about the only time I have to do this.  Thus, you must have your choices in by November 25th, 1997.  Failure to do so means you've forfeited first pick, and you are encouraged to approach us later to see about possible free slots (if any), and pre-scheduled films. 

     Thank you for your participation,
	   Mark Stapleton


  * 1.) This is a random drawing done by me.  If you think it is biased in any form ... tough!
    2.) This invitation is not a binding document to provide you, or your organization, a time slot for a film.

Dear Eric, Criseida, Mark, Grant and Eric,

I thought I'd contact you to see if UPAC CINEMA would be interested in some
leadership and/or team training by the Archer Center for Student Leadership.
We've done workshops for your group in the past, and we really enjoyed
working with you!

We offer custom-designed workshops to ALL Rensselaer organizations FREE OF
CHARGE (you'd pay $500-$1000 for such a workshop on the "outside". We are
union-funded.). We do training for club executive boards, the general
members as a whole, OR BOTH. We taylor each workshop to your specific
needs/wishes at the time. Here are some examples of past topics clubs have
asked us to cover:

* Team-building, trust development, and unity
* Member motivation and retention
* Goal setting and planning
* Team roles and dynamics
* Converting followers to leaders withing your organization
* Enhancing communication within the group
* Effective conflict resolution
* Understanding individual styles & differences
* Developing your leadership potential and style
* Communication skill-building
* Time Management
* Public speaking and giving presentations
* Delegation and empowerment
* Change management
* Creativity and "Out of the Box" thinking
* Assertiveness
* Effective decision-making
* Stress managment/relaxation training

Remember, these topics are suggestions. If you don't see something your
group needs/would like, we'll design it. We can do a workshop of any length
on any day. I know December is busy (finals etc.), but January/February is a
great time for a club workshop - middle of the year, not much school work
(yet!), a time to reexamine the group's direction & goals, and lots of other
possibilities. 

ALL workshops conducted by the Archer Center and highly interactive (no
lecturing!), energetic, and LOTS OF FUN. They look GREAT on a resume -
employers are seeking evidence of leadership training when they hire. 

We would love to design a workshop for you. Please contact me to discuss
the possibilities:

Phone: 276-2119
Email: rended@rpi.edu
Office: Rensselaer Union Top Floor, Room 206

Yours in leadership,

Hi,
My name is Brian Osman, and I'm Chair of the RPI-ACM. Below is the list
of movies we'd like to sponsor for next semester.

1) Transformers: The Movie (I doubt you can get a reel)
2) UHF
3) Hackers
4) 2001: A Space Odyssey
5) The Net

We don't care whether we're in the first or second half, though I think
I'd prefer the first half slightly. Thanks,

Brian

If possible, we'd really like to sponsor the Game, our first choice, for obvious reasons.  The Game sponsored by The Gaming Club looks cool. :)

1. The Game
2. Labyrinth
3. The Never-Ending Story
4. Willow
5. Wargames

Thanks,
Kenn Flynn
Gaming Club President

Hi Mark,

I hope the FC will again be able to work with UPAC Cinema for the coming semester...
Here are (so far) the choices of movies we'd like to sponsor:
1- Alien Resurection
2- Seven Years in Tibet
I know both of them are on the survey, and if (by any chance) there are taken, please let me know, I'll give you some further choices...
Thanks a lot.

Thomas

I know about the preliminary list, but I also know there are 14 Fridays and 
there are more than 14 movies selected so far.
Thus, I'll give you later (after I see my officers tonight) a third choice.
Another possibility would be to pick 14 movies for UPAC Cinema in which 
either "Alien" or "7 Years" is not chosen, knowing that UPAC Cinema/FC will 
show it anyway on a Saturday! Plus, the FC will take the 50/50 option, so 
the benefits will be shared and UPAC Cinema will surely make money for both 
this movie and the movie chosen for a Friday in place of it.
Do you follow?
If not, let me know.
C U.

Thomas

Dear Rensselaer Cricket Club,

I am happy to inform you that your request to show The Devil's Advocate has
been decided to be honored.  We are attempting to schedule with the 
distributor for January 17th, 1998.  

PLEASE NOTE that this is the first saturday that we get back from school
and so will need to set things up with you before you go on break.  If we
fail to set things up properly, then the movie will be in forfit, and 
UPAC-Cinema will takeover responsibility.

What do you have to do to be pre-pared?
1) download a contract and fill it out. It can be found at my web site:
   http://www.rpi.edu/~staplm
   
2) if you are union funded, you may choose the 50/50 or full option. If
   you are NOT union funded, then we must speak in person about the 
  financing of this film.  (274 - 8365)

3) Read the contract (all of it!)
4) Come talk to me about working the movie, and give me the comepleted 
   contract.

Well, I hope you've not left on vacation, and I hope to hear from you 
 soon,

	Mark Stapleton
	Saturday Night Coordinator - UPAC Cinema

Hi! This is Grace Axler from Ecologic. I was wondering if it would be
possible to reserve a Saturday night film for the fall semester.  What
dates are still availible. Also on the sheet that was sent out it said
October 4 th the lost worlsd would be showing, would it be possible to
have Ecologic sponsor that movie? If not what other options are
availible?
Thank you

Dear CASA Club,

I am happy to inform you that your request to show The Usual Suspects has
been decided to be honored.  UPAC Cinema has negotiated with the distributer
for the date of February 28th, 1998.  This is a Saturday, and the show times
will be 7pm, 9:30pm. and midnight. If this seems acceptable to you, then you
need to take the next step.  If for any reason you no longer wish to show this
movie, please notify me so that we may make this movie available for someone
else to show.

What is the next step?  The contact for your club or the person in your club
that is responsible for the club needs to get a copy of the contract and fill
it out.  A link can be found at < http://www.rpi.edu/~staplm >, or you can find
it drectly at < http://www.rpi.edu/dept/union/cinema/public_html/contract.ps >.
Print this out and complete it.  

If you are a union sponsored club, then you want the 50/50 option.  This
basically allows you to take 50% of the profits after overage and expenses
and we assume all the risk.  If you think you'll do better with the Full 
option then you may choose to do it, but this option makes you assume ALL of
the risk, and you must post $1000.00 in your account to do it.  However, you
get ALL the profits after overage and expenses.  You also PAY US for ALL LOSSES
if there are any.  

You need to read the contract, in full, and sign it to the effect that you
understand it.  Should you have any questions about it, please feel free to
call me (274 8365).  There is no "Option A", and the cartoons are not available
as a matter of choice, if we have them, we will show them.  Just put the title
of the film in the "Film Title" line, and you can leave the others blank.

Once you have read the contract and completed it, you need to get it to me. At
this point you should contact me so that I can get it, review it, and go over
what you need to to get ready for the Saturday Film.

Well, welcome to another glorious semester of RPI, bend over and get ready!

        Mark Stapleton
        Saturday Night Coordinator - UPAC Cinema

Mark,

On December 10, you said that the movie we would be sponsoring would be The
Devil's Advocate. So why has this changed to The Game in your mail sent 
yesterday, Jan 11?

That would be to me forgetting to tell you that the distributor wouldn't
give us the Devil's Advocate for this Saturday.  Truly sorry about that,
I thought I told you. Things are hectic arond this desktop.

So that leaves us with the matter of The Game for Feb 7th.  Are you "game"?
On this one, I can tell you that I have conformation for the movie, we
have it reserved for that time.

Well, this is probably beating down the same dead path, but any
"classic" computer geek movies would be great. (ie Wargames, Cloak and
Dagger, etc.) Thanks, and sorry about the e-mail, I wasn't getting it
much over vacation.

of the film in the "Film Title" line, and you can leave the others blank.

Once you have read the contract and completed it, you need to get it to me. At
this point you should contact me so that I can get it, review it, and go over
what you need to to get ready for the Saturday Film.

Well, welcome to another glorious semester of RPI, bend over and get ready!

Mark,

Is there any way we can get The Devil's Advocate? We don't mind what day 
we would be showing it. Please reply to cricket@rpi.edu and not just myself.

Dear Karen Tank, Equestrian Team,


I am happy to inform you that your request to show "Clerks" has
been decided to be honored.  UPAC Cinema has negotiated with the distributer
for the date of January 24th, 1998.  This is a Saturday, and the show times
will be 7pm, 9:30pm. and midnight. If this seems acceptable to you, then you
need to take the next step.  If for any reason you no longer wish to show this
movie, please notify me so that we may make this movie available for someone
else to show.

IF I DO NOT GET A RESPONCE BY JANUARY 19th, 1998, THEN YOUR MOVIE WILL BE IN 
FORFIT.  IT IS IMPARITIVE THAT YOU RESPOND IMMEDIATELY!  This movie is 
scheduled for the next saturday after the 17th.

What is the next step?  The contact for your club or the person in your club
that is responsible for the club needs to get a copy of the contract and fill
it out.  A link can be found at < http://www.rpi.edu/~staplm >, or you can find
it drectly at < http://www.rpi.edu/dept/union/cinema/public_html/contract.ps >.
Print this out and complete it.  

If you are a union sponsored club, then you want the 50/50 option.  This
basically allows you to take 50% of the profits after overage and expenses
and we assume all the risk.  If you think you'll do better with the Full 
option then you may choose to do it, but this option makes you assume ALL of
the risk, and you must post $1000.00 in your account to do it.  However, you
get ALL the profits after overage and expenses.  You also PAY US for ALL LOSSES
if there are any.  

You need to read the contract, in full, and sign it to the effect that you
understand it.  Should you have any questions about it, please feel free to
call me (274 8365).  There is no "Option A", and the cartoons are not available
as a matter of choice, if we have them, we will show them.  Just put the title
of the film in the "Film Title" line, and you can leave the others blank.

Once you have read the contract and completed it, you need to get it to me. At
this point you should contact me so that I can get it, review it, and go over
what you need to to get ready for the Saturday Film.

Well, welcome to another glorious semester of RPI, bend over and get ready!

I have the contract.  I reviewed it with John, and he told me that you both
agreed to switch the movie to Hackers since there was a problem with the
print of UHF.  

What do you need for Satudays?  Well, as itis stated in the contract, you 
need 6 workers.  Two people to sell tickets, two people to do security for
the movie, and one person to sell concessions if you want them, and the
last person to rip tickets.  You ALL must show up at 6pm sharp to help
set up the movie for 7pm.  

You're going to want to advertise for the movie in addition to what we
will post around campus.  Ask friends to show up, word of mouth works
quite well.

If you want to sell concessions, you're going to want to keep the total 
bought candy under $125 if you want us to buy it back from you. We don't
garuntee that we'll buy everything back, but in general we have in the 
past.  Consult me futher if you want ideas as to what to buy.


And lastly these six people do not need to be the same six all night. as
long as there is six people there for your club to help outm that is nec-
essary.  There should be at least 6 people there at the end of the night
(2 am).  The money will be deposited into OUR account, and then transfered
to yours what ever profit there is.

	- Mark Stapleton

Hi Marc,
	I just wanted to make sure you know which clubs are showing 
what.  Equestrian is showing Clerks on Saturday, January 24.  RPI-ACM is 
showing Hackers on January 31.  The Cricket Club is showing The Game on 
February 7.  Gymnastics Club is showing Addicted to Love on February 21.  
CASA is showing the Usual Suspects on February 28.  The Gorgon is showing 
the Pillow Book on March 21.  MSO can show Anastasia.  Ask them is they 
want that movie.  The Vietnamese club needs to make new picks.  The 
Gameing club is not Union Sponsored so they need to take Full Option, so 
before we let them show a movie, we need to know they can afford it 
because they will be paying up-front.  GLBA showed a movie last semester 
so they are a last resort.  Ben & Jerry's wants to show a movie next 
semester.  If you know of any other clubs which want to sponser a movie, 
let me know their movie pick and we can put them in for the second half 
of this semester.

Many Thanks,
-Jonathan Cone

Hello Mark, this is Lisa from RPI Equestrian. I had just been appointed
Captain for this semester, and tank@rpi.edu was formerly the captain. She
spoke to me about this movie, and said everything was all set; I received a
call from the CoCaptain yesterday, saying she spoke with a UPAC coordinator,
that we were all set for tonight, and that we should be there at 6:00pm to
set up..  I don't know what else needed to be done about this.

What are the costs involved?  Would we receive a portion of the proceeds?
Forgive me, I am unfamiliar with the procedure.  Thanks.

Mark,

We are definitely interested in sponsoring the movie with the 50/50 
option. I'll get you the contract next week.

Hi Mark,
This is Grace Axler from Ecologic. I emailed you at the end of last
semester requesting an Ecologic sponsored film on a Saturday night in
late APril, and I was wondering what the status was on that or what
steps would we need to take to make that happen as I never recieved your
response. Please let me know so the appropriate action may be taken.
Thank you,
Grace Axler

	Hello...I am with RPI Society of Women Engineers, and we are having our
SWE Weekend this Thursday to Sat.  This weekend is for high school females
that have been accepted to RPI.  These females are invited to RPI to see
what life is like here.  
	One of the main things RPI has to do is the UPAC movies, so we would like
to let them see the movies.  Therefore we would like to make movie passes
that the students can give to you Friday night, APRIL 3, to see the movie.
SWE will be able to reinburse you for the amount of students that attend.
Please let me know if this can be done ASAP, so we can make the passes.  
	If you have any questions pleae give me a call at x7246.  

THANKS IN ADVANCE and Sorry about the short notice,
Nancy
PS-If I am sending this to the wrong person, please let me know who I
should be getting in contact with.
