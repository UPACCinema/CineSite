Here is the first list.  The second involves getting keys made and locks
bought, which requires more coordination.

4 rolls of 1 inch macking tape.  It MUST be 1 inch.
1 roll duct tape
3 rolls of generic tickets.  They must be numbered, and of course of
different color.  I don't know where you might find these.  Maybe Office
Max?  Or even Sam's.

Bring your receipts to Martha in the office.  Give her the account number
302410.3133.009 

She will refund your money.

Thanks--Eric

PS  I am going to ask Grant or Eric Briant to go make copies of the non RPI
Coordinator keys.  You might want to join up so that you aren't both out
driving around.

If you want reimbursed for the
gas you use, first get a receipt from gas station, then go into the UPAC
office and look in the Cinema filing cabinet.  In the miscellaneous folder
is the Budget.  In there is the proper sub code (XXX) for UPAC van usage
(in faded hand written scribblings near the top of one of the pages)  Give
302410.3133.XXX  and receipt to Martha.  She will refund you.
