Dear "Club" Club,

	The Saturday night film program under the auspices of the Union 
Programs and Activities Committee - Cinema (UPAC-Cinema) has recently 
has come under new management due to a lack of personnel.
	Under previous management, you may have signed a club contract 
with us for a Saturday night film.  Please excuse us as we have lost,
destroyed, or otherwise thoroughly misplaced it.  In light of this, I am going
to start fresh by granting Fall 1997 (THIS SEMESTER) films on a first come
first served basis.  The Spring 1998 semester will be allocated by a lottery
held later.   
	
	IF YOU WANT A SATURDAY FILM, contact me now so that we
may negotiate a film contract as soon as possible.  The best way to do this is 
by phone (273 1187) or email (staplm@rpi.edu).  Please understand that 
certain dates require lead time for scheduling films, so act quickly if you are 
going to want a film in the near future.

	The only film dates reserved so far is: Sept 27 by SHPE.
Available dates that are already booked: 
			Sept. 13th	Volcano
			Sept. 20th	Shine
			Oct. 4th	The Lost World.
All other Saturdays are open.

	Mark Stapleton
	Saturday Night Coordinator
