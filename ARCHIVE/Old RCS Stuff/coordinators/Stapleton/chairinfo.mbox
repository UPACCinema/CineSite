Hi honey,

In regards to the Chair responsibilities:
 - Book movies
 - Keep in close contact with Cameron regarding the balancing of the budget
 - Keep everyone on track reagrding how our money is going (weekly @ meetings)
 - Make sure everyone is doing their jobs well.
 - Sign and stamp all bills which are then processed by Admin office (make sure 
the bills are for the right amounts)

        If you can help I really need a list of Chair responsibilities.  
Can you help put together a list?  

                - Mark
