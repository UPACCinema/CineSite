Dear Ms. Doyle,

        I am UPAC-Cinema's publicity chair, and I would like to know
if it would be possible to put UPAC-Cinema's upcoming movies up in hte
message of the day?

        Rencently one of my fellow team members on the publicity staff 
took the time to ask the Consultants in the VCC about placing this 
information in the 'message of the day' or the text that comes up before
you loggin.  My team member informed me that this would be possible
and so I am following this up.
        I had talked with the Consultants myself, and they refered me
to you.  Could you please verify this, and if true, tell me what ITS
needs to make this work.
        If you feel the need to verify my position, you should call
William Barker at x4512 or E-mail "barkew" that I am indeed Publicity
Chair.

Hi. ITS policy is to use the MOTD only for ITS computing related information.

If you want to make your information available to the campus on line, you
should send e-mail to campus-announce@rpi.edu and your information will be
posted in the usenet newsgroup rpi.campus.announce.

While the newsgroup is displayed in RPInfo, you could also have an RPInfo
home page, if you don't already. If UPAC is interested in doing that, send
e-mail to union@rpi.edu for more information on how to get your disk space,
etc. Also, read "How to get your information into RPInfo," which is available
via a hypertext link from the bottom of the RPInfo home page.

Don't forget the Review calendar. The editor puts that calendar on line as
well.

I think you can be pretty well covered on line without the MOTD. Sorry to
disappoint you, but we get a fair number of requests like yours and ITS
cannot take the time to do advertising for various groups on campus.
