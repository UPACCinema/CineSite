                     A Checklist for Team Leaders
                            by Vishal Apte
   
 - get a team ready before the Friday of the movie..

 - be at the DCC by 6:00 pm

 - team members for the first show should start arriving by 6:30

 - take 2-3 people and get ice from Russel Sage dining hall -- for     
   concessions..

 - make sure DCC308 is clean    before  the show starts.

 - setup concessions table, with tableclothes. 

 - get tickets/money from fnc.

 - possibly need line security if sellout is close.

 - Ticket prices 
   * 2.00 a person w  RPI or Sage ID
   * 3.00 with no ID (this rule is rarely enforced..)
   * 1.00 with a general UPAC card.
   * FREE with a cinema card.
   * 2 FREE tickets with a chair card.
 

 - all concessions are $0.50 each

 - individuals working that night only will recieve a 50% discount
   on items if they choose too. This does not extend to anyone who 
   is not working, including chairs.

 - For every showing -- u must have 
   *   2 people selling tickets
   *   2 people selling concessions
   *   2 people ripping tickets
   *   6 people doing security. (which includes cleanup after a showing) 
       (Security can be covered with fewer, but 6 is ideal.)
 

 - If you ever get to the point where you have nothing to do, ask the
   fnc or the projectionist -- they might need your help.
