Team Leaders

You should show up at least an hour before the first showing begins (earlier
for more popular movies).

You will need to get people to help with selling tickets, concessions,
security and ripping tickets, and line security for the more popular movies.

If you are unable to fulfil your duties as team leader on a given week, please
let the friday night coordinator know as soon as possible and/or find a
replacement.
