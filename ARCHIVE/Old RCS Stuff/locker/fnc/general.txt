General Members

All persons wishing to help at a movie should plan on showing up at least 30
minutes prior to the showing.  (An hour is preferable, especially before the
first showing)

People can volunteer to help in one of the following areas:
      Selling tickets (2) - one person collects money and gives change, and
            the other rips off tickets and marks down any free or discounted
            tickets.

      Concessions (1-3) - collect money, tell people prices, and try to keep
            candy from walking off.  

      Ripping tickets (1-2) - Rip tickets and keep people from sneaking in.

      Security (ideally 6) - Watch doors to make sure no one sneaks in.  Keep
            an eye out for alcohol, disruptive behavior, medical emergencies,
            etc.  Also (very important) stay after the show and pick up trash.

      Line security (on occasion) - Try to keep the line narrow and against
            the wall and prevent people from cutting in line.  Ensure that the
            line wraps around in an orderly fashion when it reaches the end of
            the hallway.

Setup (prior to first show)
      Get a table for selling tickets and one or two tables for selling
            concessions (depending on selection).
      Get ice for soda.  Ice can be gotten from Sage dining hall, the quad
            laundry room, or the McNeil room.
      Arrange the candy on the tables according to cost and any other method
            of organization that occours to you.

Teardown (after last show)
      Put concessions back into the concessions cabinet and put away the
            tables.  Dump out the ice and put the garbage can back in the
            booth.  
      After the movie gets out, be sure to pick up all of the trash from
            DCC 308.
