Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>This FAQ is a work-in-progress.  Feel free to suggest additional
questions, and please be patient while we complete the answers to all
current questions.</h3>
<ol>
   <li>
      <p>What is UPAC? What is UPAC Cinema?</p>
      UPAC is the Union Programs and Activities Committee.
      Technically, it is a standing committee of the RPI Student
      Union's Executive Board.  Practically, UPAC is a collection of
      student-run clubs (officially sub-committees) with the common
      purpose of providing the campus community with a variety of
      entertainment events.   Currently, the existing sub-committees
      are: UPAC Cinema, UPAC Comedy, UPAC Lights, UPAC Sound, Mother's
      Wine Emporiem, UPAC Concerts, and The Union Speakers Forum.
      <br><br>
      UPAC Cinema is a subcommittee of the Union Programs and
      Activities Committee.  It exists as a student-managed and
      student-operated second run 35mm movie theatre.  UPAC Cinema's
      purpose is to provide the Rensselaer community with motion
      picture entertainment. 
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>How do you pronounce UPAC?</p>
      &quot;You-Pack&quot;
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>On what kind of media are your movies shown?</p>
      UPAC Cinema shows movies on 35mm film, the standard in the
      motion picture industry.  On rare occasions (special events
      located outside the theatre, or very old or hard to locate
      films), we will use 16mm films and projectors.  We do
      <strong>not</strong> simply project DVDs or VHS tapes.
   </li>
   <li><p>What kind of equipment do you use?</p></li>
   <li>
      <p>What is UPAC Cinema's relationship with other UPAC
      organizations?</p>
      Historically, the seperate UPAC organizations have been run very
      independently.  While there is some cooperation between the
      subcommittees (UPAC Lights and UPAC Sound often provide their
      services to the same event, for example), they are organized,
      staffed, and managed by wholly different groups of students.  There
      is, of course, nothing preventing any particular student from
      joining more than one subcommittee.
      <br><br>
      In recent years, an effort has been made to more closely allign
      the different subcommittees.  A "Programming Board" (P-Board) has
      been formed, comprised of the chairpersons of each subcommittee.
      The P-Board's goals include scheduling a showcase each semester
      which involves all the UPAC organizations.  Even with the existance
      of the P-Board, however, each organization's operations are still
      distinct. 
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Are UPAC Cinema members paid?</p>
      Qualified Projectionists are the only paid position in UPAC
      Cinema.  These are the students who spend between one and three
      semesters training to learn how to operate the projection
      equipment to show UPAC Cinema films.  They are paid an hourly
      rate for the time they spend projecting each film.  Each film is
      projected by one projectionist.  The number of QPs in UPAC
      Cinema varies greatly, from as few as 2 to as many as 15.
      <br><br>
      All other members of UPAC Cinema are volunteers.  They help to
      operate UPAC Cinema's events for fun and for a small set of
      member benefits (see below).  They do not receive any financial
      compensation from UPAC Cinema or from the Union.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>What is a 'film series'?</p>
      A film series is a category of movies that UPAC Cinema shows.
      Each series is managed and operated slightly differently.  There
      are currently four film series in operation.  The POP Films are
      the series of movies shown every Friday night.  These are the most
      recent, most popular 2nd run films we can get a hold of.  Club
      Films are movies shown every third Saturday.   These are films
      that are sponsored by other Union clubs and organizations, both
      as a fundraiser and as a means of advertising for the sponsoring
      club.  Clubs are allowed to choose any movies they want for this
      series - provided, however, that UPAC Cinema has not chosen it
      for a POP Films movie.  MidWeek and Repertory Films are the two
      series which used to alternate every Wednesday.  They now fall
      into a once-per-three-week Saturday rotation with Club Films.  MidWeek
      Films are a combination of both movies could be POP Films if we
      had more room in the schedule, as well as "New Classics" - movies
      that might have been POP Films a few years earlier.  Repertory
      Films are movies that tend to appeal to a slightly smaller
      crowd.  These include Cult Classics, Art films, and Foreign
      films.  
      <br><br>
      A different elected UPAC Cinema officer is in charge of each
      film series.  The Friday Night Coordinator (FNC) is responsible for
      POP Films.  The Saturday Night Coordinator (SNC) is responsible
      for the Club Films.  The Midweeks Coordinator (Mid) and
      Reperatory Coordinator (Rep) are in charge of the Midweek and
      Repertory series, respectively.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>How much does admission cost?</p>
      A single ticket for one showing of a UPAC Cinema film is $2.50.
      Cash only is accepted for single tickets.  UPAC Cinema also
      sells &quot;Bulk Passes&quot;.  These cost $25 and are good for
      13 shows.  Bulk Passes do not expire.  They can be paid for
      either with cash, or by charging the cost to your student bursar
      account. 
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>How is UPAC Cinema funded?</p>
      UPAC Cinema is subsidized by the RPI Student Union.  Each year,
      UPAC Cinema (along with all other student clubs) submits a
      proposed budget to the Executive Board, detailing our expected
      costs and income.  The Executive Board then decides how much
      money to give to UPAC Cinema for the coming year.   In addition
      to the financial contribution of the Union, UPAC Cinema uses its
      income from the ticket sales and the selling of concessions to
      help pay its operating costs.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>On what days and times are movies shown?</p>
      Movies are shown every Friday and Saturday evening throughout
      the academic year.  (No movies are shown during school vacation
      weeks).  Standard showtimes are 7pm, 9:30pm, and 12am.  These
      times are occasionally altered for longer films.  
      <br><br>
      Throughout the academic year, UPAC Cinema tries to hold a few
      special events movies on non-standard days and times.  These include
      Weekend Matinees of films that appeal to families with children,
      a special GMWeek presentation of The Rocky Horror Picture Show,
      and Sneak Previews. 
      <br><br>
      UPAC Cinema's current schedule, including day and times, can
      always be found at <a
      href="http://cinema.union.rpi.edu">http://cinema.union.rpi.edu</a>.
      We also
      advertise our showtimes via weekly posters hung around campus,
      one-sheet posters in the DCC and Union, ads in the Polytechnic,
      and on the RPInfo Campus Events calendar.  (Note that the Poly
      and Events calendar have been known to get the times wrong -
      always check our website to verify).
      <br><br>
      Prior to the 2002-2003 academic year, UPAC Cinema also showed
      movies on Wednesday nights at 7pm and 10pm.  These days were
      eliminated due to a decreased budget.  Starting in 2004-2005,
      UPAC Cinema is bringing back our Wednesday films on a trial
      basis.  Check our website for our full schedule.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>What is a Sneak Preview?</p>
      Occasionally, a movie studio wants to get the public talking
      about an upcoming film.  One way they do this is by releasing
      the film to a limited number of locations, aproximately one week
      before its national release.  UPAC Cinema usually manages to
      acquire one or two of these sneak previews each year.  Because
      the film studio gives us these &quot;sneaks&quot; to increase their own
      advertising, there is no cost for admission.  A sneak preview is
      shown only once, generally on a Tuesday or Thursday evening.
      The film studio requires UPAC Cinema to hand out passes for the
      week prior to the film.  They can generally be obtained in the
      Union's Admin office.  It is very important to note that a pass
      does <strong>not</strong> guarantee admission to the film.  To
      ensure that we 
      have a full house, we are required to give out many more passes
      than the theatre can accomodate.  For this reason, the passes
      have the phrase "First Come First Served" printed on them.  When
      you show up to the theatre, you can exchange your pass for an
      admission ticket.  An admission ticket <strong>does</strong>
      guarantee admission to the film.  For popular sneak previews, it
      is recommended that you arrive, with a pass, well in advance of
      the show.  (Some customers have been known to arrive 3 hours
      early... or more).
   </li>
   <li>
       <p>What are the jobs and benefits of UPAC Cinema members?</p>
       There are four main jobs available to all general members of
       UPAC Cinema:  Selling Tickets, Ripping Tickets, Selling
       Concessions, and Security.  These jobs are open to all members
       who come to any show.  The film's coordinator will usually
       decide which members will work each position for each showing.
       <br><br>
       In addition to these positions, a member can elect to become a
       Projectionist-In-Training (PIT).  PITs work with Qualified
       Projectionists, learning how to operate the projection
       equipement.  The training process generally lasts between one
       and three semesters.  When the QPs believe a PIT is ready, the
       PIT is tested.  If the PIT passes, the PIT becomes a QP.  All
       QPs are paid to project the UPAC Cinema movies.
       <br><br>
       Members who desire a deeper involvement in UPAC Cinema can run
       for an officer position.  Officers are elected at the end of
       the Fall semester.  Officers have additional duties and
       responsibilities beyond those of the general members.
       <br><br>
       All members who fullfill an 8 show/semester requirement are
       entitled to member benefits.  These benefits include: $0.25 off
       concessions while working, free food (generally pizza or
       Chinese) on nights they work, one free ticket to each
       non-Club-sponsored movie for that member's own use, admission
       to each movie's preview conducted by the QP a day or two before
       the show, and entry into the semesterly poster lottery.
   </li>
   <li>
       <p>How can I join UPAC Cinema?</p>
       Joining is very easy.  UPAC Cinema will have a table at the
       annual Activities Fair in the first week of the fall semester.
       There, you can sign up for Cinema's mailing list, and you will
       be notified of the date and time of our first meeting.  If you
       cannot make the Activities Fair, or you want to join after the
       fair, simply come to any of our movies in DCC 308.  Ask to
       speak to an officer, and express your interest in joining.
       <br><br>
       There are no membership dues or fees of any kind for being a
       member of UPAC Cinema.  You can work as little or as often as
       you wish (though to receive benefits, you must fulfil an
       eight-show requirement - see above).  
   </li>
   <li>
       <p>What is involved in being a projectionist?</p>
       The process towards becoming a Qualified Projectionist starts
       with talking to a current QP.  They can explain to you
       everything involved in the job of projecting UPAC Cinema
       movies.  Some of the duties include: Assembling ("building")
       the films from several small reels onto two large reels;
       projecting a test-run (preview) of each of your movies (usually
       one or two days before the movie is shown);
       recording statistics such as movie length, film quality,
       changeover locations, etc; projecting all three showings of the
       film on its night; disassembling ("breaking down") the film
       back into its small reels; and of course, training new
       Projectionists in Training on their way to becoming QPs.
       <br><br>
       Due to the more involved duties of being a projectionist, QPs
       are the only paid position in UPAC Cinema.  Talk to a current
       QP for more information.
   </li>
   <li>
       <p>What is the operating budget of UPAC Cinema, and what does it
       cover?</p>
       Each Spring, UPAC Cinema submits a requested budget to the
       Union's Executive Board.  The following year's actual budget is
       decided by the E-Board after a series of reviews, decisions,
       and appeals.  For the 2004-2005 academic year, UPAC Cinema's
       budget is ___________.   Among the line items this amount
       covers are:  Rental of ____ Friday and Saturday films; Rental
       of ____ Wednesday
       films (back for 2004-2005 on a trial basis); shipping fees for all
       films; trailers and posters
       for as many of our movies as we can purchase; publicity
       materials such as the weekly posters hung on Campus Notice
       boards and semesterly schedules printed four times each year;
       and projectionists' payroll.
       <br><br>
       All activity-fee paying students are entitled to view the
       budgets of any Union club.  To see UPAC Cinema's (or any other
       club's) budget, go to the Admin office of the RPI Union, and
       ask to speak with Martha McElliot.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>What's with the &quot;Whoop&quot;ing during trailers?</p>
      This is a long standing tradition in UPAC Cinema.  After the
      policies, if we have any trailers for upcoming movies, we show
      them before the feature presentation.  The very short 'tags'
      that precede the trailers have a disturbingly catchy jingle.  At
      one predefined moment during this tag, many of our customers
      will shout out "WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP".  Somewhere along the way, a
      side tradition was developed of replying to the Whoop'ing
      customers with a hearty bellow of "Shut up, Geek!".  In more
      recent years, this side tradition somehow morphed into the
      rather nastier reply that exists today.  (UPAC Cinema, of
      course, neither condones nor in any way prohibits such
      phraseology, though our customers would do well to take into
      account the demographic make-up of the audience before engaging
      in this tradition - especially during any "kid" films, or
      perhaps during Family weekend...).
      <br><br>
      As for why anyone shouts the Whoop's to begin with, if you ever
      come to a less popular show, you may be able to hear that the
      Whoop's are in fact part of the sound track of the trailer tag.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>What is UPAC Cinema's relationship with other Union
      clubs?</p>
      UPAC Cinema offers Union-recognized clubs the opportunity to
      sponsor a UPAC Cinema movie.  This provides the club with both the
      ability to advertise or promote its events, as well as a
      fundraiser.  Most clubs take the "50-50" option when sponsoring
      a movie.  This means that UPAC Cinema will front the cost of the
      film, shipping, and projectionist, and the club will provide the
      manpower (other than a projectionist).  If the movie makes a
      profit (after deducting the cost of the film, shipping, and
      projectionist), UPAC Cinema and the club split the profits 50/50.
      If the movie does not make a profit, the loss is taken soley by
      UPAC Cinema, and the club is not responsible.
      <br><br>
      Daring clubs (and any non-Union-funded organizations) can
      take the "Full option" instead of 50-50.  This means that the
      club or organization will front the full cost of the movie -
      film, shipping, projectionist, and manpower.  Should the movie
      make any profit at all, that money goes directly do the club.
      If it does not, the club will be at a loss, and UPAC Cinema will
      not be responsible.
      <br><br>
      Regardless of the option chosen, a sponsoring club is also
      permitted to sell their own concessions during the movie.
      Should a club elect to sell concessions, UPAC Cinema will agree
      not to sell its own concessions on that night.  Any
      profits made from the sale of concessions will then belong to the club.
